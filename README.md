###Remarks
We used a temporary signal to store the value of store the result of additions and subtraction. 
The temporary signal was one bit longer to calculate overflow and carryout.
The reason why we used temporary signal was because you can't read from result because it is an out port.
Division by 2 is unsigned.

###Bugs
We tested and nothing was wrong
